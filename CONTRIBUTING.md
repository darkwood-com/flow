## Bug reports

Please search existing issues first to make sure this is not a duplicate.
Every issue report has a cost for the developers required to field it; be
respectful of others' time and ensure your report isn't spurious prior to
submission. Try to be as detailed as possible in your problem description
to help us fix the bug. Please adhere to
[sound bug reporting principles](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html).

## Feature requests

If you wish to propose a feature, please submit an issue. Try to explain your
use case as fully as possible to help us understand why you think the feature
should be added.

## Creating a pull request

First [fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) on
GitHub.

Then clone your fork:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:darkwood-fr/flow.git
$ git checkout -b bug-or-feature-description
```

And install the dependencies:

```bash
$ composer install
```

Write your code and add tests. Then run the tests:

```bash
$ make test
```

Commit your changes and push them to GitHub:

```bash
$ git commit -m ":sparkles: Introduce awesome new feature"
$ git push -u origin bug-or-feature-description
```

Then [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)
on GitHub.

If you need to make some changes, commit and push them as you like. When asked
to squash your commits, do so as follows:

```bash
git rebase -i
git push origin bug-or-feature-description -f
```
