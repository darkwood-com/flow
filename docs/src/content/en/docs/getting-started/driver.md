# Driver

Flow embark multiple drivers.

## Coroutine

Drivers are useful to essentially provide asynchronous programming by using [coroutines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine).
Thus, this can be implemented in severals ways in most popular programming languages.

Coroutine are very similar to [threads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)) and provide concurrency but not parallelism.
Advantage of using coroutine :
- this can be a preferred usage to thread for [hard-realtime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing#Hard) context.
- there is no need for synchronisation primitives such as mutexes, semaphore.
- it reduces the usage of system lock for sharing resources.

## Amp Driver
